## ⚠️ Security Warning

This project is a learning exercise that allows an AI agent to run arbitrary Python code within a specified working directory.

**Do not**:

- Expose this as a public service or API.
- Let untrusted users run it on your machine.
- Use it in production or with sensitive data.

The code is intentionally simplified and **does not** include all the security, sandboxing, or isolation features required for safe real-world use. It is for educational and local experimentation only.
